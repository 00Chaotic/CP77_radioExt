# RadioExt
A mod for CP2077 that allows for the addition of custom car radio stations, by using an external audio player hidden behind the regular game UI and inputs.

#### How to use:

- [CET](https://github.com/yamashi/CyberEngineTweaks) Version 1.18.1+ is required
- Download and install the mod from [LINK HERE]

#### How it works and what it does:

- This mod uses an external audio player, in the form of an `.asi`
- The audio player gets hooked up to the game's radio interface using a CET based mod
- This way the custom stations look, sound and behave just like the ones already in the game

## How to create new radio stations:

1. Navigate to the mod's folder, located in `Cyberpunk 2077\bin\x64\plugins\cyber_engine_tweaks\mods\radioExt\radios`

2. Create a new folder in there, with a unique name, e.g. `radioExt\radios\myRadio`

3. Copy the `metadata.json` file, which is located in the mods main folder `Cyberpunk 2077\bin\x64\plugins\cyber_engine_tweaks\mods\radioExt\metdata.json`, into your newly created radio station folder

4. Change the values inside this file to your liking:
	- `displayName` is what gets displayed as the stations name
	- `fm` is a number, if the `displayName` has a FM number it should be the same, which is used to place the station at the right place in the stations list
	- `icon` is the icon for the station. It can be any `UIIcon.` record. To find a list of all records, open the CET console's `TweakDB Editor` tab, and enter `UIIcon.` in the search bar (Make sure you have the [tweakdb.str](https://cdn-l-cyberpunk.cdprojektred.com/metadata-1.5.2.zip) file placed inside the `Cyberpunk 2077\bin\x64\plugins\cyber_engine_tweaks` folder)
	- `customIcon` is used to specify a custom icon. For more information on this topic, go to the "How to use a custom icon" section
	- `volume` is the overall volume multiplier for the station

5. Place any song you want inside the stations folder e.g. `radioExt\radios\myRadio`
	-  Only `.mp3` and `.wav` is supported
	- Try to keep the file size small (<10mb per file)
	- File names are not allowed to contain special characters such as emojis, apostrophes and dots. Try to keep it as simple as possible.
	- Keep in mind that the songs file names are being used as song names ingame, so keep them clean
	- At least 3 songs per station are required, no upper limit

6. Now you should have a folder structure that looks something like this:
	```
	├── radioExt
		└── radios
			└── myRadio
				└── metadata.json
				└── customSong1.mp3
				└── customSong2.mp3
				└── customSong3.mp3
	```

7. Launch the game

## How to use a custom icon:
- All settings related to custom icons are inside the `customIcon` section of a stations `metadata.json` file
- `useCustom` if this is set to `false` the icon specified inside `icon` will be used. If set to true the custom icon will be used
- `inkAtlasPath` points to the `.inkatlas` that holds the icon texture, e.g. `base\\gameplay\\gui\\world\\vending_machines\\atlas_roach_race.inkatlas` (Path requires double backslashes `\\`)
- `inkAtlasPart` specifies which part of the `.inkatlas` should be used for the icon, e.g. `gryphon_5`
